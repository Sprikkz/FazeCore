force_resources: false
resource_stack:
# Resource packs are applied bottom-to-top. This means that higher stacks override resources in lower packs.
# Entries here should indicate the name of the resource pack file.
# Example:
# - vanilla.zip
# - FazeMC.zip
# If you want to force clients to use vanilla resources, you should put the vanilla resource pack in your resources folder and add it to the stack here.
# Example of adding a pack:
# - "vanilla.zip"
# - "FazeMC.zip"
